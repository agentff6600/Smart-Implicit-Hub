# SomaPixel

SomaPixels are part of the SomaBit toolkit and are built for applications such as the SomaMattress. 

A SomaPixel is motorized using a linear actuator, which allows it to be raised or lowered. A pressure sensor embedded on top of each actuator is used to control its position.

In this particular application, the pressure sensors sends its sensor readings to the "Smart Implicit Hub". The "Smart Implicit Hub" then forwards the modified readings to the linear actuator, which changes its position.

For detailed instructions on how to use the SomaPixels, please read this [README](../SomaPixelTemplate/README.md).
